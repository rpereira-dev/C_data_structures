This is a C data structures library

It contains:
    - Array lists
    - Linked list (which can be used as Queue or Stacks without performance loss)
    - Binary trees (which aren't auto-balanced yet)
    - Hash map

Strings and graphs are not ended and compiled into the library yet

HOW TO COMPILE:
>> make -C ./data_structures/
>> cc your_program.c libcstruct.a -I ./C_data_structures/includes
